Overview

This repository contains the ontology GSN-Remediation, developed to support ontology-based semantic integration of green-synthesized nanomaterials, their physicochemical profiles, remediation mechanisms, sustainability attributes, and provenance.
It accompanies the manuscript:

Ontology-Based Semantic Integration of Green-Synthesized Nanomaterials for Environmentally Sustainable Remediation Processes.

The goal is to enable FAIR, machine-actionable, and interoperable knowledge representation for adsorption and photocatalytic remediation workflows.
